What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

I learned how I would add enemy sprites that shoot back.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

Same thing as above. I wouldve liked to add a enemy that shoots back.

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

Nothing. The code was near perfect. There is a few minor bugs such as the enemies staying on the screen after the win or lose screen.

What could have been clearer or better commented?

The code was well commented. 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

There was nothing that was overall confusing.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

Yes it does. 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

Maybe instructions on how to play the game. 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

Their code was neat and well made. Good Job!

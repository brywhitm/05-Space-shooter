The purpose of this project is to create a 2D space shooter game.
To score 18 points
You will need to have a ship that is controlled by the player (mouse or keyboard).
Your game will need to have enemies or obstacles.
You will need to have a scoring system.

 Weapons and bullets, levels, etc. are optional (but can be a source of additional points).

 created a 2D space shooter. You have 4 lives (really 5) and you have to destroy the enemys to win. If you do you loose. (there is a small bug were bullets will take more then one life. that is because the way the programs set up the enemys can fire multiple shoots in one. basiclly the shoot a bullet within a bullet.)
